        While I was working at APITIC for one year, I gained experience{' '}
        <span className='font-bold'>improving how food businesses perform</span>{' '}
        by working on various SaaS products for big food chains like Eat Sushi.
        While I interned at Getro, helping people find meaningful jobs, I built{' '}
        <span className='font-bold'>
          React components and created unit tests in each React component we
          were building using Jest and Enzyme
        </span>
        . To improve our work, I have also created a Storybook component library
        so the team could dynamically play with components before using them.
