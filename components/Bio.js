        Hi! I am Alexandre Mouriec, a Full Stack Developer and recent Computer
        Science graduate in France, specialized in Web Development. I am
        applying to join Alan as a Software Engineer to use my full-stack
        development skills to help Alan grow.

        While I was working at APITIC for one year, I gained experience in
        improving how food businesses perform by working on various SaaS
        products for big food chains like Eat Sushi. While I interned at Getro,
        helping people find meaningful jobs, I built React components and
        created unit tests in each React component we were building using Jest
        and Enzyme. To improve our work, I have also created a Storybook
        component library so the team could dynamically play with components
        before using them.

        I am used to working on full-stack development, recently with Gatsby.js,
        Tailwind CSS, and Strapi.js, and am currently learning Next.js. I have
        also practiced my writing skills for a few years as a technical writer
        for a French news media.
